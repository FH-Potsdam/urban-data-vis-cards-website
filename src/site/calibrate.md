This is the instructions page for the Critique activity. An overview of the card deck and all activities can be found here.

Advice for all activities

If you are short on card-decks, we also have a digital version you can use in online collaboration apps.

To kick off each activity use our UDV introduction slides (see QR-code).

For all activities you will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).

We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).

The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.

Purpose

Improve an existing urban data visualisations, based on a set of dimensions.

Preparation

Per visualisation prepare at least two screenshots (overview & detail), a short description of the visualisation, the data behind it and it’s context, as well as a link to the live version (if available).

Activity

1. Intro of workshop & participants.
2. Groups get to know the visualisation
3. Each participant picks (at least) one dimension card and summarises it to the group.
4. Group selects (max.) 3 dimensions they think are most important to the presented challenge.
5. The groups set up the dimension scales for the selected dimensions.
6. Flip the axis to highlight the current state of the visualisation.
7. Place the marker to indicate how it should be improved.
8. Sketch ideas how to improve the vis.
9. To inspire the process, each group goes through the reflection cards, that are relevant for the selected dimensions.
10. Presentation of results. 

Next Step

This activity should have helped you get closer to a final concept. If you want to further improve, use another iteration of either Critique or Calibrate activities.
