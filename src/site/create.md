This is the instructions page for the Create activity. An overview of the card deck and all activities can be found here.

Advice for all activities

If you are short on card-decks, we also have a digital version you can use in online collaboration apps.

To kick off each activity use our UDV introduction slides (see QR-code).

For all activities you will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).

We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).

The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.

Purpose

Based on an urban challenge develop data-driven concepts for potential visualisation solutions. 

Preparation

Define the challenge and its require-ments (e.g. user groups and their expectations) and contextual infor-mation (e.g. where and how will it be deployed). If data exists, provide details (e.g. dimensions, origin). 

Activity

1. Intro of workshop & participants.
2. Presentation of challenge.
3. Each participant picks (at least) one dimension card and summarises it to the group.
4. Group selects (max.) 3 dimensions they think are most important to the  presented challenge.
5. The groups set up the dimension scales for the selected dimensions.
6. Jointly position the green markers (X) onthe dimension axis, reflecting the re-quirements for the presented challenge.
7. In groups of 2 (max 3) the participants sketch out ideas for potential visualisations.
8. To inspire the process, each group goes through the reflection cards, that are relevant for the selected dimensions.
9. Presentation of results. 

Next Step

If you have multiple outputs, use Critique to find the best result for the challenge. Or use the Calibrate activity to further refine the result as a second iteration.
