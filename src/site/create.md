<p style="font-size:13px;">This is the instructions page for the <b>Create</b> activity. An overview of the card deck and all other activities can be found <a href="/">here</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Instructions for Create activity</strong></h4>
<p><b>Time required: 2 hours.</b> The time may vary depending on level of expertise of participants, group size and complexity of the topic.</p>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>Based on an urban challenge develop data-driven concepts for potential visualisation solutions.</p>
<h4>Advice for all activities</h4>
<p>
If you are short on card-decks, we also have a digital version you can use in online collaboration apps.

To kick off each activity use our UDV introduction slides (see <a href="/#downloads">downloads</a>).

For all activities you will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).

We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).

The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.
</p>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<p>Define the challenge and its require-ments (e.g. user groups and their expectations) and contextual infor-mation (e.g. where and how will it be deployed). If data exists, provide details (e.g. dimensions, origin).Â </p>
