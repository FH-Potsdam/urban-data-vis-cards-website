<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">To kick things off use our UDV introduction slides (see <a href="/#downloads">downloads</a>).</span>

<li class="workshop-section__focus-list-item">
<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">You will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).</span>
</li>
<li class="workshop-section__focus-list-item">
<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).</span>

<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.</span>
