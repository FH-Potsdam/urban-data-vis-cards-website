This is the instructions page for the Critique activity. An overview of the card deck and all activities can be found here.

Advice for all activities

If you are short on card-decks, we also have a digital version you can use in online collaboration apps.

To kick off each activity use our UDV introduction slides (see QR-code).

For all activities you will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).

We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).

The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.

Purpose

A guided group reflection to analyse the weaknesses and strengths of urban data visualisations.

Preparation

Per visualisation prepare at least two screenshots (overview & detail), a short description of the visualisation, the data behind it and itâ€™s context, as well as a link to the live version (if available).

Activity

1. Intro of workshop & participants.
2. Each group receives one vis and familiarises themselves with it.
3. Each participant picks (at least) one dimension card and summarises it to the group.
4. Group selects (max.) 3 dimensions they think are most important to the presented challenge.
5. The groups set up the dimension scales for the selected dimensions.
6. In regards to the selected dimensions, discuss the weaknesses and strengths of the visualisation.
7. To inspire the process, each group goes through the reflection cards, that are relevant for the selected dimensions.
8. Use the green markers (X) on the dimension axis to highlight to indicate the weaknesses and strengths.
9. Presentation of results. 

Next Step

If you want to improve the vis based on the identified characteristics, use the Calibrate activity. If you want to use this as a starting point to develop a new visualisation, use the Create activity.
