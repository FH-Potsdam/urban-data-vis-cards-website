This is the instructions page for the Critique activity. An overview of the card deck and all activities can be found here.

Advice for all activities

If you are short on card-decks, we also have a digital version you can use in online collaboration apps.

To kick off each activity use our UDV introduction slides (see QR-code).

For all activities you will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).

We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).

The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.

Purpose

Starting from a collection of urban visualisations, organising and curating a selection (e.g. for an exhibition or book). 

Preparation

Per visualisation prepare some reference material (e.g. screenshots or links) and an outline of the target collection and itâ€™s requirements for which to jointly select visualisations.

Activity

1. Intro of workshop & participants. 
2. Present the outline of the desired collection and its focus. 
3. Each participant picks (at least) one dimension card and summarises it to the group.
4. The group selects all dimensions that fit the theme of the collection.
5. The groups set up the dimension scales for the selected dimensions as reference. Each scale has 5 steps.
6. The group jointly classifies all the visualisations in each dimension.
7. Based on the results the group can then discuss which visualisations rank the highest across the target dimensions and select the best fitting visualisations for the collection.

Next Step

An organised collection can help with other activities, as it is now easy to find visualisations that match certain criteria (e.g. complexity for novice users) and thereby, serve as reference examples.
