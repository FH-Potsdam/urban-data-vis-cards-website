<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">To kick things off use our UDV introduction slides (see <a href="/#downloads">downloads</a>).</span>

<li class="workshop-section__focus-list-item">
<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">You will need workshop materials (pencils, postIts, paper, etc).</span>
</li>
<li class="workshop-section__focus-list-item">
<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">We recommend groups of max. five people. If working with larger groups split the groups up (more card decks required).</span>

<span class="workshop-section__focus-list-item--headline">The time given for each activity is a rough minimum. The activities can easily be extended by either giving more time for each step or combining activities, e.g. create + critique or critique + calibrate. You can also speed up the activities by preselecting the dimensions for the session.</span>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<p>Per visualisation prepare some reference material (e.g. screenshots or links) and an outline of the target collection and itâ€™s requirements for which to jointly select visualisations.</p>

<h4>Activity schedule</h4>

<section class="section instructions-section">
	<div>
		<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>As the focus of the activities is to collaboratively solve the tasks, start by introducing the activity participants to one another. Follow up by introducing the workshop concept. We have some <a href="/#downloads">slides prepared</a> you can use.</p>

		<h2>2. Existing Visualisation</h2>
		<p>Each group receives one visualisation and familiarises themselves with it. Highlight requirements, context, targeted audiences, data, etc. (see Preparations).</p>

		<h2>3. Dimensions overview</h2>
		<p>Each participant picks (at least) one dimension card and summarises it to the group. For each dimension there is an overview card, highlighting connected considerations as colored circles and a description on the back. In addition two cards for the two extremes of the dimension.</p>

		<h2>4. Dimension selection</h2>
		<p>Group selects (max.) 3 dimensions they think are most important to the  presented challenge. <i>This step can take up quite some time. If time is limited preselect the dimensions and skip this step.</i></p>

		<h2>5. Scale setup</h2>
		<p>The groups set up the dimension scales for the selected dimensions. In this activity setup the scale cards without crosses. Put the extremes on each side. If you have enough space put the description card of the dimension next to it as backup.</p>

		<p>To inspire the process, each group goes through the reflection cards, that are relevant for the selected dimensions. On the dimension overview cards the colored circles highlight which consideration cards are relevant for each dimension.</p>

		<h2>10. Presentation of results</h2>
		<p>To finish up, each group presents the results to each other and discuss the outcomes of the workshop. <i>Taking either video recordings or photos and audio recordings helps documenting the thoughts that go into each concept.</i></p>

<h4>Next Step</h4>

<p>An organised collection can help with other activities, as it is now easy to find visualisations that match certain criteria (e.g. complexity for novice users) and thereby, serve as reference examples.</p>
</section>

2. Present the outline of the desired collection and its focus. 
3. Each participant picks (at least) one dimension card and summarises it to the group.
4. The group selects all dimensions that fit the theme of the collection.
5. The groups set up the dimension scales for the selected dimensions as reference. Each scale has 5 steps.
6. The group jointly classifies all the visualisations in each dimension.
7. Based on the results the group can then discuss which visualisations rank the highest across the target dimensions and select the best fitting visualisations for the collection.
